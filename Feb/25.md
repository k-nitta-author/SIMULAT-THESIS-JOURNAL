After completing a **Discord** Voice chat with my comrades, *Caitlin Datu* and *Elijah Escondo*, I made promises and pulled on the reins of their trust in me to see this project through to its completion. This needed to succeed--anything less than that meant repeating another semester at least. I could not let that happen. 

During the voice chat we had, we decided on a litany of things, the foundation of what we hoped would make for SIMULAT. We agreed, each of us, to split the work so as to let certain members focus on specific components of the system in specialized work so as to keep from crossing each other during SIMULAT's development.
